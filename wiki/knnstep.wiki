*the steps of using knn model in this project:*
  # get the similarity matrix by (knn/getSim.cpp). Change the parameter before executing the programme.
  # get k-max similarity for each item by (knn/getkmaxth.cpp). Specific the K before executing the programme.
  # predcit the ratings and calculate the test set RMSE by (knn/knn_ml.cpp)
