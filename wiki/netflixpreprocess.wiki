the steps of pre-process the netflix dataset


= Details =

the steps of pre-process the netflix dataset is as follows:
  * make the userId sequential  
    # scan all the ratings to get a map between original userId and new sequential userId ,and scan all the rating files and transfer the rating to new sequential userId . (./dataset/netflix/getUserSeqId.php)->get new rating files in ./dataset/netflix/transfer_set/<br/>
       php getUserSeqId.php  //(this is a script of php, you should have php installed, maybe I will rewrite this programme in c++ soon)
      _important notice_
        because there are 17770 files to deal, the php programme takes a lot of memorys, you'd better change the memory limit of php to more than 1G(it's usaully 16M in default). The step to change the memory limit: a.  Find the php.ini file. "php -i | grep 'php\.ini'",  b. Change the memory limit. find the memory limit setting section and change it.<br/>
   
    # transfer the probe set and training set. (./dataset/netflix/transferProbeUserId.cpp)<br/>
     ./dataset/netflix/probe.txt->./dataset/netflix/probe_t.txt   
  * merge the rating files to one file (./dataset/netflix/mergeData.cpp)
      ./dataset/netflix/transfer_set/(files) ->./dataset/netflix/data.txt
  * get the real rate of the probe set (./dataset/netflix/getProbeReal.cpp)
   ./dataset/netflix/probe_t->./dataset/netflix/probe_real.txt
    
  * get the training dataset without probe ratings(./dataset/netflix/getDataWithoutProbe.cpp)
    ./dataset/netflix/transfer_set/(files) ->./dataset/netflix/data_without_prob.txt
